        ---------
        permutations : int
            the number of permutations to run for the inference,
            driven by conditional randomization.
        unit_scale : bool
            whether to enforce unit variance in the local statistics. This
            normalizes the variance of the data at inupt, ensuring that
            the covariance statistics are not overwhelmed by any single
            covariate's large variance.
        partial_labels : bool, default=True
            whether to calculate the classification based on the part-regressive 
            quadrant classification or the univariate quadrant classification,
            like a classical Moran's I. When mvquads is True, the variables are labelled as:
            - label 1: observations with large y - rho * x that also have large Wy values.

            - label 4: observations with large y - rho * x values that have small Wy values.
        alternative : str (default: 'two-sided')
            the alternative hypothesis for the inference. One of

        Attributes

        connectivity : The weights matrix inputted, but row standardized
        D : The "design" matrix used in computation. If X is
            not None, this will be [1 y X]
        R : the "response" matrix used in computation. Will
            always be the same shape as D and contain [1, Wy, Wy, ....]
        DtDi : empirical parameter covariance matrix
            the P x P matrix describing the variance and covariance
            of y and X.
        P : the number of parameters. 1 if X is not provided.
        association_ : the N,P matrix of multivariable LISA statistics.
            the first column, lmos[:,1] is the LISAs corresponding
            to the relationship between Wy and y conditioning on X.
        reference_distribution_ : the (N, permutations, P+1) realizations from the conditional
            randomization to generate reference distributions for
            each Local Moran statistic. rlmos_[:,:,1] pertain to
            the reference distribution of y and Wy.
        significance_  : the (N, P) matrix of quadrant classifications for the
            part-regressive relationships. quads[:,0] pertains to
            the relationship between y and Wy. The mean is not classified,
            since it's just binary above/below mean usually.
        partials_: the (N,2,P+1) matrix of part-regressive contributions.
            The ith slice of partials_[:,:,i] contains the

            and the second indicating the part-regressive design.

            partials_[:,:,0] corresponds to the partial regression
            describing the relationship between y and Wy.
        labels_ : the (N,) array of quadrant classifications for the
            part-regressive relationships. See the partial_labels argument

        conditional randomization
        for observation i with ni neighbors,  the candidate set cannot include
        i (we don't want i being a neighbor of i). we have to sample without
        replacement from a set of ids that doesn't include i. numpy doesn't
        directly support sampling wo replacement and it is expensive to
        implement this. instead we omit i from the original ids,  permute the
        ids and take the first ni elements of the permuted ids as the
        neighbors to i in each randomization.
