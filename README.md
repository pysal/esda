## Installation

Install esda by running:

```
$ pip install esda
```


## Requirements

- libpysal

### Optional dependencies

- `numba`, version `0.50.1` or greater, is used to accelerate computational geometry and permutation-based statistical inference. Unfortunately, versions before `0.50.1` may cause some local statistical functions to break, so please ensure you have `numba>=0.50.1` installed.
